# Product Roadmap & Feature Suggestions

## 1. Functional Enhancements (High Impact)

### PDF Payslip Generation
*   **Status:** ✅ Completed
*   **Current State:** The system generates a ZIP file containing individual PDF payslips for all employees in the uploaded batch.
*   **Value:** This adds immense value for HR managers who need to distribute slips immediately after processing, eliminating manual work.

### Statutory Deductions (NSSA / NEC / SDF)
*   **Status:** ✅ Completed
*   **Current State:** The engine supports configurable calculation logic via Settings.
*   **Value:** This transforms the tool from a specialized "Tax Engine" into a "Complete Payroll Calculator," serving a broader range of business needs.

### "What-If" Salary Calculator
*   **Status:** ✅ Completed
*   **Current State:** A standalone tool in the dashboard allows users to input a **single salary (USD or ZiG)** and instantly see the net pay and tax breakdown.
*   **Value:** Great for quick checks during hiring negotiations or salary reviews.

## 2. Monetization & Branding (New)

### White-Labeling (Agency Tier)
*   **Status:** ✅ Completed
*   **Current State:** Agency/Enterprise users can upload their own logo to appear on PDF payslips, and the "Generated by Zim-PayConnect" footer is removed.
*   **Value:** Critical for Accounting Firms who want to resell this service to their clients.

### Pay-Per-Process (Micro-transactions)
*   **Status:** 📅 Planned
*   **Suggestion:** Add a "Pay-as-you-go" option for one-off users (e.g., $5 for a single report).
*   **Value:** Captures the "freelancer/small startup" market segment who don't need a monthly sub.
